# Chromosomal Translocation

Translocation is when a piece of one chromosome is recombined with a piece from another chromosome. The two chromosomes are not homologous; they have to be different chromosomes. This recombining happens because the two chromosomes have similar segments that enable them to cross over during meiosis.
